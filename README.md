- This project was created as part of the AI course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I would like to thank the instructors and the course material for helping me build my understanding of AI concepts. Particular shoutout to Prof. Margaret Fleck as she is one of the best profs I had an experience with at UIUC, she is amongst the few profs in the ECE department who are actually capable of teaching concepts in a concise and effective way.
